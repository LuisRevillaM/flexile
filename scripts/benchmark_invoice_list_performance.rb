# Usage instructions
puts <<~USAGE
  üéØ Invoice List Performance Benchmark
  
  This script benchmarks two aspects of invoice list performance:
  
  1. Full ActiveRecord Query Performance
     - Tests the complete application query with joins and includes
     - Shows real-world performance including all overhead
  
  2. Index-Focused SQL Performance  
     - Isolates the composite index optimization
     - Tests only the WHERE/ORDER BY clauses without join overhead
     - Better demonstrates the specific index improvement
  
  The composite index optimizes:
  - WHERE company_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL
  - ORDER BY invoice_date DESC, created_at DESC
  
  üöÄ To see the improvement:
  
  1. Run this script BEFORE applying the migration:
     ruby scripts/benchmark_invoice_list_performance.rb --run
  
  2. Apply the migration:
     rails db:migrate
  
  3. Run this script AFTER applying the migration:
     ruby scripts/benchmark_invoice_list_performance.rb --run
  
  Expected improvement: 5-50x faster for the index-focused queries
