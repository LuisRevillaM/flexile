# Usage instructions
puts <<~USAGE
  üéØ Invoice List Performance Benchmark
  
  This script benchmarks the performance of the invoice list query that's used
  in the TRPC endpoint (frontend/trpc/routes/invoices.ts).
  
  The query filters by:
  - company_id = [current company]
  - deleted_at IS NULL
  
  And orders by:
  - invoice_date DESC, created_at DESC
  
  üöÄ To see the improvement:
  
  1. Run this script BEFORE applying the migration:
     ruby scripts/benchmark_invoice_list_performance.rb
  
  2. Apply the migration:
     rails db:migrate
  
  3. Run this script AFTER applying the migration:
     ruby scripts/benchmark_invoice_list_performance.rb
  
  Expected improvement: 5-50x faster for companies with 1000+ invoices
